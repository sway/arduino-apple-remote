# Apple Remote library for Arduino

This library uses a IR led to emit codes that mimic those sent by the [Apple
Remote][1].

The IR led is expected to be wired to your Arduino's pin #3.

## Code example

Emitting signals.

```c
#include <apple-remote.h>
#define SIGNAL_MAX_LENGTH 70

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Point your IR led to an AppleTV.");
}

void loop()
{
  // This is like pressing the real "menu" button.
  Serial.println("Sending signal: menu.");
  apple_remote_menu();
  delay(100000);
}
```

Receiving signals

```c
#include <apple-remote.h>

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Point your IR led to an AppleTV.");
}

void loop()
{
  unsigned int signal[SIGNAL_MAX_LENGTH];
  bool captured;
  int code;

  captured = irdebug_capture_signal(signal, SIGNAL_MAX_LENGTH);

  if (captured) {
    irdebug_print_signal(signal);
    code = apple_remote_match(signal);

    switch (code) {
      case APPLE_REMOTE_MENU:
        Serial.println("[menu]");
        break;
      case APPLE_REMOTE_RIGHT:
        Serial.println("[right]");
        break;
      case APPLE_REMOTE_LEFT:
        Serial.println("[left]");
        break;
      case APPLE_REMOTE_UP:
        Serial.println("[up]");
        break;
      case APPLE_REMOTE_DOWN:
        Serial.println("[down]");
        break;
      case APPLE_REMOTE_PLAY:
        Serial.println("[play]");
        break;
      case APPLE_REMOTE_CENTER:
        Serial.println("[center]");
        break;
      case APPLE_REMOTE_REPEAT:
        Serial.println("[repeat]");
        break;
      default:
        Serial.println("[?]");
    }
  }
}
```

## How to install

1. Install the [irdebug.h][2] library.
2. Copy the `lib/apple-remote/` directory to your Arduino's library path, for
	 example: `sudo cp -r lib/apple-remote /usr/share/arduino/libraries/`.
3. Include the `apple-remote.h` file into your main Arduino code, for example
	 `#include <apple-remote.h>`.
